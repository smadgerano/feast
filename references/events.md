## Using Events for Themes

When an event approaches:

1. **Research traditional foods** — What's eaten and why
2. **Understand the significance** — Don't be tone-deaf
3. **Find respected authentic recipes** — From native sources with good reviews
4. **Match music** — Traditional and contemporary
5. **Consider appropriateness** — Some events may not suit all users

## Notes

- Dates marked "varies" change yearly (lunar calendar, etc.)
- This is not exhaustive — add events as relevant to users
- Always research before planning — avoid stereotypes and mistakes
- Do not invent events or cuisines
